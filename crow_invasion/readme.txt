[PYGAME MODULE IS REQUIRED]

You are a foolhardy little cat daring to oppose the endless fleet of crows, all by yourself! 
Luckily, you have a superpower - you can shoot laser beams from your eyes - and you do not hesitate to use it.

Cats are known to have many lives. Although you do not initially possess them, you can gain them while eliminating the crows. When you see a heart, shoot green beams at it to claim it. Be careful not to hit it with your deadly red beams - the hearts are too fragile to stand them.

The merciless crows will grow more and more furious. Let's see how long you'll manage to hold your ground!
